In this project we have first analysed the probability of the value of any card drawn. We have also calculated the chances of landing a Royal Flush hand of the Poker game for increasing number of suits.

I have used Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib to graphically demonstrate the findings of data analysis.

Please read the report for additional details.
